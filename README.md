#Hi there, I'm Ahmed Bishr 👋

🤖 Aspiring AI Engineer & Researcher

I am currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport.

While I have a background in software development, my true passion lies in the mathematical foundations of Deep Learning and the potential of AI to solve complex problems. I am currently transitioning my focus entirely to Data Science, Computer Vision, and Neural Networks.

I believe that the best way to master AI is to understand the "why" behind the equations, not just the "how" of the code.

🔭 Future Vision & Goals

My ultimate goal is to become a Fullstack AI Engineer—someone who can not only design and train complex models but also deploy them efficiently into production environments.

Short-term Goal: Master the mathematical underpinnings of Deep Learning (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability) and become proficient in PyTorch.

Mid-term Goal: Contribute to open-source ML libraries and publish research in the field of Computer Vision or NLP.

Long-term Vision: To build end-to-end intelligent systems that are scalable, ethical, and impactful.

🧠 "I am still learning, exploring, and breaking things. This profile is a documentation of my journey from code to cognition."

🌱 Current Learning Focus

I am dedicating my time to bridging the gap between theory and practice:

Deep Learning: Implementing papers from scratch to understand architecture nuances.

Mathematics: Diving deep into optimization algorithms and statistical learning theory.

Frameworks: Moving from "using" libraries to "understanding" their internal mechanics (specifically PyTorch).
