## 🤖 Aspiring AI Engineer & Researcher

I am currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport.

While I have a background in software development, my true passion lies in the mathematical foundations of Deep Learning and the potential of AI to solve complex problems. I am transitioning my focus to Data Science, Computer Vision, and Neural Networks.

I believe the best way to master AI is to understand the "why" behind the equations, not just the "how" of the code.

## 🔭 Future Vision & Goals

- Short-term: Master the mathematical underpinnings of Deep Learning (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability) and become proficient in PyTorch.
- Mid-term: Contribute to open-source ML libraries and publish research in Computer Vision or NLP.
- Long-term: Build end-to-end intelligent systems that are scalable, ethical, and impactful.

## 🌱 Current Learning Focus

- Deep Learning: Re-implementing papers from scratch to understand architecture nuances.
- Mathematics: Optimization algorithms and statistical learning theory.
- Frameworks: Moving from "using" libraries to "understanding" their internals (PyTorch focus).
